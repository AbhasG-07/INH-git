## Getting Started

1. **Fork this repository** to your GitHub account by clicking the "Fork" button in the top-right corner of the repository page.

2. **Clone the forked repository** to your local machine:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/Xplore.git
```
Replace `YOUR_USERNAME` with your actual GitHub username.

3. **Navigate to the project directory**:
```bash
cd Xplore
```

4. **Create a new branch** for your changes:
```bash
git checkout -b feature/your-feature-name
```
Replace `your-feature-name` with a descriptive name for your feature or change.

## Basic Git Commands

### Checking Status
To see the current status of your repository:
```bash
git status
```

### Viewing Branches
To see all branches and identify the current branch:
```bash
git branch
```

### Switching Branches
To switch to an existing branch:
```bash
git checkout branch-name
```

To create a new branch and switch to it:
```bash
git checkout -b new-branch-name
```

### Stashing Changes
To temporarily store your changes without committing:
```bash
git stash
```

To apply the most recent stash:
```bash
git stash pop
```

To list all stashes:
```bash
git stash list
```

To apply a specific stash:
```bash
git stash apply stash@{n}
```
Replace `n` with the stash number.

### Resetting Changes
To unstage changes (but keep them in your working directory):
```bash
git reset HEAD file-name
```

To discard changes in your working directory:
```bash
git checkout -- file-name
```

To reset to a specific commit:
```bash
git reset --hard commit-hash
```
Be cautious with `--hard` as it discards all changes!

## Making Changes

5. Make your desired changes to the codebase using your favorite code editor.

6. **Stage your changes**:
```bash
git add .
```
This command stages all the changes you've made.

To stage specific files:
```bash
git add file-name1 file-name2
```

7. **Commit your changes** with a descriptive message:
```bash
git commit -m "Add feature xyz"
```
Replace `"Add feature xyz"` with a concise description of your changes.

<hr>
ðŸš¨ **Potential Issue:** If you encounter an error saying `nothing added to commit but untracked files present`, it means you have new files that haven't been staged. Run `git add .` again and then commit your changes.
<hr>

## Pushing Changes

8. **Push your changes** to your forked repository:
```bash
git push origin feature/your-feature-name
```
Replace `your-feature-name` with the name of your branch.

<hr>
ðŸš¨ **Potential Issue:** If you encounter an error saying `remote origin already exists`, you may need to set the upstream repository by running:
```bash
git remote add upstream https://github.com/SharanRP/Xplore.git
```
Then try pushing your changes again.

## Additional Git Commands

### Viewing Commit History
To see the commit history:
```bash
git log
```

For a more concise view:
```bash
git log --oneline
```

### Fetching Updates
To fetch updates from the remote repository without merging:
```bash
git fetch origin
```

### Merging Changes
To merge changes from another branch into your current branch:
```bash
git merge branch-name
```

### Resolving Conflicts
If you encounter merge conflicts, Git will mark the conflicting areas in your files. Manually resolve these conflicts, then:
```bash
git add .
git commit -m "Resolve merge conflicts"
```

### Pulling Changes
To fetch and merge changes from the remote repository:
```bash
git pull origin main
```
Replace `main` with the branch name you want to pull from.
